# Changelog

Dated log of drastic/significant changes — bug fixes touching core flows (checkout, cart, payments, auth, seller system), multi-file fixes, and new features. Newest first. See `CLAUDE.md`'s "Change Documentation & System Notes" section for when an entry here is required, and `docs/systems/` for full prose write-ups of whole systems.

## 2026-09-17 — Delivery network: planning complete (audit + spec + execution plan), no implementation yet

**What happened:** Founder pasted a full 196-section delivery/logistics network design doc (address validation, service zones, road-distance pricing, multi-store bundling, rider dispatch/batching, route/stop state machines, customer tracking + PIN confirmation, notifications, admin ops, animation system, 20 final design principles). Asked for: an audit against the real schema, a concrete execution plan produced by Fable (`model: fable` via the Agent tool) fed with that audit, reconciliation against the full original plan to catch anything Fable's plan missed, and a persistent spec document to keep returning to across sessions.

**What was done:**
- Enabled PostGIS on the live Supabase project (`create extension postgis`).
- Full schema/codebase audit — key finding: a rich fulfillment state machine (`order_item_statuses`) already exists for *service* pickup/return (July 2026 build), plus a `rep_availability`/`logistics.html` rep app, plus a live, working delivery-fee tariff in `checkout.html`/`validate-cart.js` — none of which the original plan (written without schema access) could have known about.
- Wrote `docs/systems/delivery-network-spec.md`: full original plan preserved verbatim, founder's explicit modifications recorded (fixed R15 priority fee, use the live tariff not the plan's illustrative one, defer the bundle *engine* but design schema for it, no in-page GPS nav — just 90s position-staleness degradation on the customer map), a running "action needed from founder" list, and Fable's full execution plan (concrete migrations, files, parallelizable work units, and flagged concerns per stage).
- Reconciled Fable's plan against the full 196 sections and caught two real gaps Fable's plan didn't cover anywhere: compliments/complaints (§96–98) had no table/file/stage at all, and `driver_payouts` was referenced but never actually created in any migration. Both patched into the plan (new Stage 13b; `driver_payouts` added to Stage 10). Also added priority-aware dispatch ordering (§22) which Fable's simplified nearest-driver algorithm had dropped.

**Not done yet:** no delivery-system code, migrations (beyond PostGIS), or tables have been written. Three decisions need explicit founder sign-off before Stage 2 starts (trigger-based PayFast integration for "payment confirmed → delivery job created," layering new distance pricing on the existing tariff vs. replacing it, exposing a referrer-restricted Google Maps browser key the same way the Supabase anon key is already exposed) — listed in the spec doc's §C along with API keys/addresses/thresholds only the founder can provide.

**Full write-up:** `docs/systems/delivery-network-spec.md` — this is the living reference; keep returning to it rather than re-deriving the plan.
**Commit:** *(pending — not yet committed as of this entry)*

## 2026-09-16 — Fix signed-in Buy Now: unawaited cart sync overwrote it after load

**Reported as:** Logged-in buyer using Buy Now on a shop page saw the correct shop/price banner, but the order summary showed "1 item" with no item rendered, R0 total, and delivery stuck at R12 (the "small" class fallback). Paying said "cart is empty."

**Root cause:** `checkAuth()` (checkout.html) calls `updateAuthUI(user)`, which fires `syncCartOnLogin(user)` **without awaiting it**, right after `loadCart()` has already correctly rendered the buy-now item. `syncCartOnLogin()` has no concept of a buy-now cart — it only looks at `ss_cart` (empty during Buy Now) and the buyer's `carts` table row (possibly stale from earlier sessions) — and unconditionally overwrites `state.cart` with whatever it finds a moment later, after the correct render already happened. Its own item-mapping was also a fourth copy of the same incomplete-field bug (no `delivery_class`/`seller_id`/etc.), which is why delivery fell back to R12.

**Fix (`checkout.html` only):**
- Added `state.isBuyNow`, set true inside `loadCart()`'s buy-now branch.
- `syncCartOnLogin(user)` is now only called when `!state.isBuyNow` — a buy-now cart must stay fully isolated from the buyer's real cart.
- `syncCartOnLogin()`'s merge now re-fetches fresh product data via `refreshCartItemsFromProducts()` instead of trusting the stale/incomplete server-cart shape directly (fixes the same bug for the *normal* signed-in flow too).

## 2026-09-16 — Fix shop.html cart items dropping delivery/pricing data; add custom delivery price

**Reported as:** Buy Now on a shop page (Isqalo Shisanyama, R99 plate) sent the buyer to checkout with the wrong delivery fee (R12 "small" instead of the product's real R22 "medium").

**Root cause:** `shop.html` has its own separate, minimal cart-item builder (not shared with the main site's `script.js` — there's no shared JS module between pages) that only ever carried `id/title/price/qty/size/img/stock/maxQuantity`. It never included `delivery_class`, `seller_id`, `listing_type`, `free_delivery`, `units_per_trip` — for either "Add to Cart" *or* "Buy Now", and for both the product-modal button and the card's quick "+ Add" button (which used an even more minimal snapshot than the modal). checkout.html's own DB re-fetch usually backfilled `delivery_class`/`seller_id`, which is why it *usually* looked fine — but on any fetch failure it silently fell back to the untouched (missing) client data, producing the wrong fee or, worst case, letting a $0-priced item through.

**Fix:**
- `shop.html`: unified both entry points onto one `buildCartItem()` that carries the full field set; the card quick-add now resolves the full product record from `allProducts` (same as the modal already did) instead of a stripped-down snapshot; added a price-unavailable guard on both buttons. Also removed an unrelated pre-existing bug: a broken `updateCartCount()` call in a second, separate `<script>` block that threw `ReferenceError` on every page load (the function is scoped to the first block's IIFE and was never global; the badge is already correctly initialized from within that first block).
- `checkout.html`: both cart-loading paths (`refreshCartItemsFromProducts` for guest/buy-now, `loadAndValidateCartItems` for signed-in server cart) now backfill `listing_type`/`free_delivery`/`units_per_trip`/custom `delivery_price` too, and a failed product re-fetch now throws (surfaced as an explicit empty-cart error) instead of silently trusting incomplete client data.
- `netlify/functions/validate-cart.js`: server-authoritative rejection (400) if a physical product's resolved price is ≤0; mirrors the custom delivery price override logic exactly.
- `admin.html`: added "Custom Delivery Price (R)" to product create/edit, stored at `products.metadata.delivery_price` (no new column) — overrides the Small/Medium/Large class price for that product.
